# SyncEvent

UI/UX Case Study: SyncEvent - Automated Synchronous  Event Management Application

- A streamlined mobile and web application designed to organize, manage, and 
track events with ease and minimal stress.

## Problem Statement

- One of the problems I've personally encountered and observed when organizing 
an event is the lack of organization, which leads to delays and inefficiencies. During an 
event, when resources are scattered, pressure and stress increase, especially when the 
expected output takes too long to materialize. 

## Solution: SyncEvent 

- SyncEvent is a solution designed to centralize event planning and management. 
With all essential information in one place, it becomes easy to manage and assign 
workers, track event status, and log event history. This tool can be used by both small 
teams and large organizations to efficiently handle events.
